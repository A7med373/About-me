Welcome to Ahmed's GitHub Repository
I'm a beginner programmer with a passion for learning and exploring new technologies. I'm currently learning Java and Python, and I'm eager to apply my skills to create meaningful projects.

As a beginner, I haven't completed many projects yet. However, I'm proud of my recent work on a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. I learned a lot from this project, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a programmer.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thanks for visiting!
